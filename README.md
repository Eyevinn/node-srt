`@eyevinn/srt` is a Node.js Native Addon that provides bindings to [Secure Reliable Transport SDK](https://github.com/Haivision/srt).

## Install

```
npm install --save @eyevinn/srt
```

Installing from NPM downloads and builds SRT SDK and NodeJS addon for your operating system Ã— architecture.

## Prerequisities

Please refer to build instructions for your OS of the [SRT project](https://github.com/Haivision/srt#requirements).

This is providing a NodeJS binding layer that at its build-time assumes that plain libSRT already *can* be built on your system.

We will merely pull in an SRT codebase from a GIT repo here (that may be local or remote), and attempt to compile it (using the specific toolchain and commands invoked for each OS). See `scripts/build-srt-sdk.js`. Then linking the result of it into the compiled NodeJS add-on we provide here via the Gyp tool.

Everything we need on the NodeJS side of things (N-API, Gyp) gets installed via NPM,
as you install this package.

However, it is not provided with this any prerequisits of building libSRT itself (we only try to invoke the toolchain correctly, whichever it is, on your OS).

As you install all of the prerequisites, or even build the library already in your environment, this package should work also likewise.

## Example

```
const { SRT } = require('@eyevinn/srt');

const srt = new SRT();
const socket = srt.createSocket();
srt.bind(socket, "0.0.0.0", 1234);
srt.listen(socket, 2);
const fd = srt.accept(socket);
if (fd) {
  const chunk = srt.read(fd, 1316);
}
```

## API

```
class SRT {
  createSocket(sender?:Boolean): socket:Number
  bind(socket:Number, address:String, port:Number): result:Number
  listen(socket:Number, backlog:Number): result:Number
  connect(socket:Number, host:String, port:Number): result:Number
  accept(socket:Number): fileDescriptor:Number
  close(socket:Number): result:Number
  read(socket:Number, chunkSize:Number): chunk:Buffer
  write(socket:Number, chunk:Buffer): result:Number
  setSockOpt(socket:Number, option:Number, value): result:Number
  getSockOpt(socket:Number, option:Number): value
  getSockState(socket:Number): value:Number
  epollCreate(): epid:Number
  epollAddUsock(epid:Number, socket:Number, events:Number): result:Number
  epollUWait(epid:Number, msTimeOut:Number): events:Array
  stats(socket:Number, clear:Boolean): stats:SRTStats
}
```

### Async API

The N-API binding layer to the SRT SDK is such that every native call are blocking I/O and runs synchroneuosly with the wrapping JS function call. This means that these functions are called from the Node.js proc main-thread / event loop. This creates a throughput limit and in general having blocking operations can impact application performance in an unpredictable way. To address this issue we have an "async variant" of the API where the native blocking calls are put on a JS Worker thread instead (big thanks to @tchakabam for this [contribution](https://github.com/Eyevinn/node-srt/pull/6)). The Async API is a candidate to replace the main API in the next major release. Example with async/await:

```
  const { SRT, AsyncSRT } = require('@eyevinn/srt');

  (async function() {
    const asyncSrt = new AsyncSRT();
    const socket = await asyncSrt.createSocket(false);
    let result = await asyncSrt.bind(socket, "0.0.0.0", 1234);
    result = await asyncSrt.listen(socket, 2);
  })();
```

or with promises:

```
  const { SRT, AsyncSRT } = require('@eyevinn/srt');
  const asyncSrt = new AsyncSRT();

  let mySocket;
  asyncSrt.createSocket(false)
    .catch((err) => console.error(err))
    .then((result) => {
      mySocket = result;
      return result;
    })
    .then((socket) => asyncSrt.bind(socket, "0.0.0.0", 1234))
    .then((result) => {
      if (result !== 0) {
        throw new Error('Failed bind');
      }
      return asyncSrt.listen(mySocket, 2);
    })
    .then((result) => {
      if (!result) {
        console.log("Listen success");
      } else {
        throw new Error('SRT listen error: ' + result);
      }
    });  
```

### High-performance read/write use-cases & server/multi-connection implementation

In order to perform on certain use-cases where larger chunks of data split into packets
would need to be sent/received in bursts, we provide "modes" and a high-level class called `AsyncReaderWriter`, which can be initialized an existing `AsyncSRT` instance, i.e a worker thread, and a given SRT socket identifier. It therefore allows to plug-into any concept of a
connection on either side. A client connection instance can therefore just be a socket created
with a successful connection state via the SRT API, and then using the reader-writer for
any sort of transmission upon it.

Also, we provide a class to allow building a server that can accept multiple incoming connections(`SRTServer` and its friend `SRTConnection`). The latter server-side connection object has the method `SRTConnection#getReaderWriter()` to allow using the reader-writer
in order to communicate with the respective client.

The best example to see all this in action at once is taking a look at the respective integration test(s).

These components also all have JSdoc annotations that should help with their usage.

### Readable Stream
A custom readable stream API is also available, example (in listener mode):

```
const fs = require('fs');
const dest = fs.createWriteStream('./output');
const { SRTReadStream } = require('@eyevinn/srt');

const srt = new SRTReadStream('0.0.0.0', 1234);
srt.listen(readStream => {
  readStream.pipe(dest);
});
```

of in caller mode:

```
const srt = new SRTReadStream('127.0.0.1', 1234);
srt.connect(readStream => {
  readStream.pipe(dest);
});
```

### Writable Stream

Example of a writable stream

```
const fs = require('fs');
const source = fs.createReadStream('./input');
const { SRTWriteStream } = require('@eyevinn/srt');

const srt = new SRTWriteStream('127.0.0.1', 1234);
srt.connect(writeStream => {
  source.pipe(writeStream);
});
```
